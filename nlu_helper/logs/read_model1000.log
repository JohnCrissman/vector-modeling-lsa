Compare: Cancer begins in cells. Cells are the building blocks that make up all parts of our bodies, including our breasts. Cancer begins when the cells in the breast change and grow into a tumor. If not removed or treated, a breast cancer tumor can spread to other parts of the body and become lethal. These days, there are many treatment options for breast cancer and the majority of women are cured of breast cancer.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

It aims to get rid of cancer cells that may have spread from the breast to other parts of the body. Therefore, chemotherapy and targeted therapy reduces the chances of breast cancer coming back. There are three types of systemic therapy: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years.

Compare: For most types of cancer, doctors use staging information to help plan treatment and to predict a person's outlook (prognosis). Although each person's situation is different, cancers with the same stage tend to have similar outlooks and are often treated the same way. The cancer stage is also a way for doctors to describe the extent of the cancer when they talk with each other about a person's cancer.

Compare: The most common symptom of breast cancer is a new lump or mass. A painless, hard mass that has irregular edges is more likely to be cancer, but breast cancers can be tender, soft, or round. They can even be painful. For this reason, it's important to have any new breast mass, lump, or breast change checked by an experienced healthcare professional.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

If not removed or treated, a breast cancer tumor can spread to other parts of the body and become lethal. These days, there are many treatment options for breast cancer and the majority of women are cured of breast cancer.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

Compare: Cancer begins in cells. Cells are the building blocks that make up all parts of our bodies, including our breasts. Cancer begins when the cells in the breast change and grow into a tumor. If not removed or treated, a breast cancer tumor can spread to other parts of the body and become lethal. These days, there are many treatment options for breast cancer and the majority of women are cured of breast cancer.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Although each person's situation is different, cancers with the same stage tend to have similar outlooks and are often treated the same way. The cancer stage is also a way for doctors to describe the extent of the cancer when they talk with each other about a person's cancer.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Compare: For most types of cancer, doctors use staging information to help plan treatment and to predict a person's outlook (prognosis). Although each person's situation is different, cancers with the same stage tend to have similar outlooks and are often treated the same way. The cancer stage is also a way for doctors to describe the extent of the cancer when they talk with each other about a person's cancer.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

Compare: For the majority of women, breast cancer is not a death sentence. In the U.S., fewer women have been dying from breast cancer since the 1990s. Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

It is normal to feel sad, angry, or frustrated sometimes and positive and hopeful and other times. People with a positive attitude may be more likely to stay social, which is important for cancer survivors. Getting physical activity through walking or exercise and emotional support are also helpful for women who had breast cancer.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

If not removed or treated, a breast cancer tumor can spread to other parts of the body and become lethal. These days, there are many treatment options for breast cancer and the majority of women are cured of breast cancer.

Compare: Systemic therapy refers to medicine that treats the entire body. Systemic therapy for breast cancer is usually given directly into your body through a thin needle or as a pill. It aims to get rid of cancer cells that may have spread from the breast to other parts of the body. Therefore, chemotherapy and targeted therapy reduces the chances of breast cancer coming back. There are three types of systemic therapy: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy.

Compare: Cancer begins in cells. Cells are the building blocks that make up all parts of our bodies, including our breasts. Cancer begins when the cells in the breast change and grow into a tumor. If not removed or treated, a breast cancer tumor can spread to other parts of the body and become lethal. These days, there are many treatment options for breast cancer and the majority of women are cured of breast cancer.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Women whose breast cancer has not spread to other organs in their body like the lungs, liver, or brain, have over a 90% chance of being alive in 5 years. How long each person diagnosed with breast cancer will live and whether she will die from the disease depends on many things, including how much the cancer has spread throughout the body, the woman's overall health, and more.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Compare: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a healthcare professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.

Compare: For most types of cancer, doctors use staging information to help plan treatment and to predict a person's outlook (prognosis). Although each person's situation is different, cancers with the same stage tend to have similar outlooks and are often treated the same way. The cancer stage is also a way for doctors to describe the extent of the cancer when they talk with each other about a person's cancer.

RESULTS 
Compare: The most common symptom of breast cancer is a new lump or mass. A painless, hard mass that has irregular edges is more likely to be cancer, but breast cancers can be tender, soft, or round. They can even be painful. For this reason, it's important to have any new breast mass, lump, or breast change checked by an experienced healthcare professional.

Compare: Lumpectomy is a type of surgery to remove the cancer tumor while saving the nipple and as much of the breast as possible. Depending on how much the cancer has spread, removal of some lymph nodes might also take place during a lumpectomy. A lumpectomy is also called breast conserving surgery.

Compare: Systemic therapy refers to medicine that treats the entire body. Systemic therapy for breast cancer is usually given directly into your body through a thin needle or as a pill. It aims to get rid of cancer cells that may have spread from the breast to other parts of the body. Therefore, chemotherapy and targeted therapy reduces the chances of breast cancer coming back. There are three types of systemic therapy: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy.
