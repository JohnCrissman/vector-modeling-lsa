LP3,"Research has not found that your attitude or level of stress causes cancer or makes cancer come back. It is normal to feel sad, angry, or frustrated sometimes and positive and hopeful and other times. People with a positive attitude may be more likely to stay social, which is important for cancer survivors. Getting physical activity through walking or exercise and emotional support are also helpful for women who had breast cancer.",Breast cancer is not directly a death sentence. ,"Cancer in the breast, if not treated, can move to other parts of the body and cause death.","Academically, there is no link between the stress level of a patient and the development of cancer.","We cannot assure that if you have a positive attitude you can beat the cancer, but based on survivors experiences, it's important to keep close relationships so you can feel supported, and keep working out so you can feel healthy.","There is no scientific evidence about the relation between stress, attitude and cancer. It is normal that a person can have different moods during their days, so sometimes they can feel sad, angry or frustrated; and other days happy and optimistic.  People with positive attitudes tend to be social which helps to avoid depression; also having someone to talk to about anything is very important for those who have overcome the disease.","A stressful lifestyle or negative attitude cannot cause cancer, but being positive is correlated with helpful survival skills, such as socializing and exercising."
