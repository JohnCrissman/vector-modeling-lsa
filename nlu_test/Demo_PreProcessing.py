Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on January 25, 1989, at 10 a.m. to hold a hearing on the recent trend in corporate restructurings, mounting debt in the corporate sector, and the relationship of these trends to the tax law. \n \n', '\n\n Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I have three amendments to offer which I understand are acceptable to the managers on both sides. Before I do that, I want to commend our colleague from California, Mr. Wilson, for the outstanding amendment which he has offered the Senate and on which we will be voting I trust soon. \n Mr. President, I suppose it is easier for me and for that matter Senator Wilson to be critical of the franking issue, the use of the frank, the abuse of the frank because neither he nor I are running for election. We are both leaving the Senate. So it is a lot easier for us to address the franking privilege. \n Before anyone accuses me of hypocrisy, I want to acknowledge that, like I suppose virtually everyone in this Chamber, I have overly used the frank from time to time, and to be even more honest I have abused the frank. And if there is a Senator in this Chamber who has not I would like to nominate that Senator for sainthood because he or she is a noble Senator indeed. \n The fact of the matter is the frank is grossly overly used, and frankly it is abused. Let us face it. It is one of the prerogatives Members of Congress use to get reelected. It is one of the reasons why the reelection rate in the House of Representatives, for example, for those who seek reelection is 98.5 percent. At least it was in the last election. That is outrageous. \n We used to hear about the imperial Presidency. Now it is imperial Congress, or if you will the invisible Congress, the unconquerable Congress. One of the reasons we have such a sluggish and almost nonexistent turnover in the membership of this body, and in particular the House, is that the incumbents have such enormous advantages over challengers. One of those enormous advantages, let us be honest, is the frank, the ability to use that frank, to save it up, and to use it heavily prior to an election cycle so that we can get our name out there before the American people. I did it. I think most Members have done it. It is an enormous temptation. So let us deal with it sensibly removing the temptation. \n That is what the amendment of the Senator from California would do. It would simply zero out funds for mass mailings and devote the savings to a very praiseworthy and humanitarian effort--namely, the relief of these distressed children who are born to mothers who have abused drugs. It would devote the savings to that and to other programs in the area of dealing with this terrible problem of drug abuse in our society. \n We will hear a lot of rhetoric in the next few weeks about the so-called war on drugs and the new battle plan, if you will. Here is a way for us to get off on the right foot. Here is a way for us to set an example. \n President Bush, in his address, said it is essential that everyone get involved--everyone. Well, we are not used to thinking of ourselves as every man. We like to exempt ourselves from the laws that we pass and the regulations that we force upon everyone else. But maybe it is time to turn over a new leaf. I certainly think it is, and here is the good opportunity to do just that. \n So I commend the Senator from California, and it is an outstanding, excellent amendment. I hope it will be adopted. I urge him to stick to his guns and insist upon a rollcall vote so that in conference our negotiators, our conferees, will have a strengthened hand in keeping the Wilson amendment intact and making it a part of the appropriations bill as it comes out of the conference. \n \n', '\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

Mr. President, I know the patience of the Senator from Nebraska, because I have been fishing with him, and he is very patient. \n Mr. President, my question is this: Did the members of your committee, the Armed Services Committee, explore the options for seeking the result that the Secretary wished? For instance, did they explore the concept of bonuses for performance or lumpsum payments, not salaried, in addition to existing salary? Were there any other options selected by the Armed Services Committee to achieve the results without disturbing the whole pay network of the Federal Government? \n \n', '\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Library Services and Construction Act [LSCA]. This bill represents the largest Federal program which specifically funds libraries. The money go toward construction of facilities, general library services, library services for Indian tribes, foreign language materials acquisition, and library literacy programs. \n There can be no questioning the importance of this bill to my own State of Vermont. Two-thirds of the libraries in Vermont serve populations of fewer than 2,000 people. These are geographically isolated areas without access to major metropolitan libraries. Yet, while geographically isolated, they are not isolated from access to information, thanks to the services rendered to them through the LSCA. \n Title I of the bill provides my State of Vermont with education and training for its librarians, 90 percent of whom come to libraries with no training whatsoever. \n In 1988, Title II of the bill provided Vermont with $100,000 for building construction and improvement. Last year, Vermont used this money to help finance a new town library where previously none existed. Federal funds only accounted for 10 percent of the total costs, but to a small State such as my own 10 percent is crucial. \n Title III of the bill is probably the single most important title of LSCA for my State. Title III moneys go to facilitate interlibrary loans and access to information. Because of this money, each of the small libraries throughout the State can access the large research libraries such as the one situated at the University of Vermont. This telecommunications capability is at no expense to the university--all access is done through computer network. Clearly, this effective and essential activity could not have been provided without Federal money. \n Furthermore, LSCA provided Vermont with $50,000 worth of computer printed catalog cards which otherwise would have had to be done by staff. It provided consultant services to libraries for computer training, catalog updates, and general services. Finally, LSCA has provided institutional libraries with long overdue services for the blind and handicapped. \n This bill clearly expands services to States. It gives children and adults a glimpse into a whole new world by giving them access to information and books. I have outlined the financial assistance provided to Vermont through the LSCA--what I cannot do so easily but which is far more important is tally the countless number of children and adults who have benefited from this program. \n \n', "\n\n  Mr. WIRTH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor several Vietnamese-American students from the State of Colorado whose outstanding academic performance merits special notice by this Congress. \n The Vietnamese-American Cultural Alliance of Colorado, a nonprofit service organization composed of Vietnamese immigrants and Americans of Vietnamese origin, has selected several young people to be honored in recognition of their exemplary academic standing. These youngsters have made a highly successful transition from one distant and different culture to another and now, because of their courage, perseverance, and excellence as citizens of this country, have become exemplary students. For this reason I feel each one of these students deserves special acknowledgement by the Senate. \n The recipients of the 1989 Colorado Awards for Academic Excellence are: Erica Le, kindergarten; Giang Kiet Lihn, grade 6; Mary Hoatam, grade 5; Tien Duc Nghia, grade 4; John Nguyen, grade 1; Nguyen Thi Tran, grade 6; Nguyen Nam, grade 3; Than Cao Thien, grade 5; Le Thi Nga, grade 4; Lam My Thanh, grade 4; Nguyen Hai, grade 2; Nguyen Phu, grade 2; Tran Thi Thu, grade 4; Chung Huy, grade 3; Nguyen Thao, grade 4; Nguyen Tuyet, grade 4; Huynh Ngoc Linh, grade 2; Mimi Nguyen Thien Huong, grade 3; Lyna Nguyen, grade 8; Hoang Thi Huong, grade 6; Jimmy Ngo, grade 6; Le Tram, grade 7; Dang Quoc Anh, grade 8; Tran Tan, grade 6; Nguyen Chau Ha, grade 9; Hang Hoang, grade 8; Luong Chay, grade 7; Tran Uyen Phan, grade 8; Nguyen Hoang, grade 7; Nguyen Chi, grade 6; Vo Truc, grade 8; Pham Thi Diem, grade 8; Nguyen Quynh Nhu, grade 8; Nguyen Thi Thu-Quang, grade 9; Nguyen Thi Hanh, grade 8; Van Tan Tai, grade 8; Quach Cam Ha, grade 8; Jackie Nguyen, grade 6; Ann Nguyen, grade 7; Hang Bao Quoc, grade 9; Nguyen Thi B. Hanh, grade 8; Vu Quoc Khanh, grade 12; Vu Thanh, grade 10; Ngo Trong Khanh, grade 11; Ngo Duy Anh, grade 12; Nguyen Kim Thuy, grade 11; Trieu Nguyen Hahn, grade 11; Nguyen T. Phu, grade 11; Ngo Tuan, grade 11; Ngo Tai, grade 9; Ngo Tu, grade 9; Nguyen Ha, grade 11; Tran Thu Quyen, grade 12; Nguyen Anh Khoa, grade 10; Nguyen Thanh, grade 10; Tran Uyen-Thy, grade 11; Nguyen H. Minh, grade 12; Nguyen Dung, grade 11; Tram Manh Quang, grade 10; Sue Do, grade 12; Vo Thuy Vu, grade 11; Nguyen M. Hanh, grade 12; Nguyen Trien, grade 11; Dang Kim Chau, grade 9; Vo Thanh Phuong, grade 11; Ly Tien, grade 11; Bui Quoc Thang, grade 12; Bui Thuy Trang, grade 9; Sue Nguyen, grade 11. \n Unfortunately, space does not permit a description of each student's accomplishments. However, I can say that each of these students has achieved extraordinary academic standing--earning a perfect 4.0 grade point average or better. \n Let me also extend my thanks to the Vietnamese-American Cultural Alliance of Colorado, without whose support and dedication to community service, these special kids would not have been recognized. Henry Tuoc V. Pham, the president of the alliance, has done an outstanding job of encouraging academic excellence among young Vietnamese-American students. His hard work, along with the love and support of their families, certainly shows in the fine academic performance of these 69 young Coloradans.  \n \n", "\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on October 16, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski presented an address entitled `America's Changing Global Role' at a dinner in honor of Paul H. Nitze at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University in Washington, DC. \n In his speech, Dr. Brzezinski describes the evolution of the U.S. role in the world, from isolationism in the early part of the century to active engagement in World War II and the cold war. He then looks forward to America's leading a coalition of democratic States in contructing the post-cold war international order. \n Because of the timeliness and vision of Dr. Brzezinski's address, I want to share it with my Senate colleagues. \n \n", '\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a number of my colleagues on the Education Subcommittee in proposing this package of technical amendments to the Impact Aid Program. \n This package of legislation is very important if we are to continue our support for the Impact Aid Program, which provides money to school districts who have been federally impacted through a military installation or by land acquisition by the Federal Government. \n These amendments are technical corrections to the Impact Aid Program incorporated into Public Law 100-297, the Hawkins-Stafford Act. This law rewrote the impact aid formula in an attempt to bring greater equity to the program. This new formula was worked out under the advice of the school districts and the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools. \n Unfortunately, some problems arose with the new language that the orginal drafters could not predict. It is essential that we pass this technical package, otherwise school districts throughout this country will face shortfalls in their funding because impact aid payments will not be able to be made. \n Without these technical amendments, the Department of Education will not be able to make B payments to school districts. During the reauthorization of the Impact Aid Program, the power to prorate B payments was inadvertently omitted. If there is a shortfall in appropriations, the Department of Education does not have the legal authority to reduce the payments to these B districts. A shortfall occurred this year and has unfortunately caused a standstill in the program. Districts that depend on this money to operate are facing the possibility of closing their school house doors if they do not receive this money. \n Another unfortunate problem that arose because of the shortfall in appropriations was districts who had an increase in the number of federally connected children could not be compensated for this increase. These technical amendments remove the hold harmless cap on the A program so payments can be made for these new students. In order to remove the cap and allow a flow of funds for new students to these A districts, we also had to place a cap on the 3(d)2(B) section. \n One of the unintended results of the new formula was the increase in the 3(d)2(B) reserves. Although the cost runs about $10 million annually, $50 million was reserved for this section as required by the new law. In order to release funds for the new children in the A districts, a cap of $20 million was placed on the 3(d)2(B) section to release the extra $30 million. The $20 million is well above the amount that has ever been paid for the 3(d)2(B) payments and the remaining $30 million will flow into the A section providing relief to districts with larger increases of new children. If we do not release these funds, we will be asking school districts to educate more children with less money. \n This package has bipartisan support and I hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass these necessary and very important technical amendments. \n \n', '\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my vote tonight is a vote to give this body an opportunity to prevent employers from continuing to set up health plans that discriminate in favor of their highly paid management employees and having that discrimination paid for by middle-income taxpayers. \n The income tax exclusion for health benefits costs the Federal Government billions of dollars. That loss is made up by raising revenue from other sources, namely the middle-income taxpayers who pay into Treasury most of the revenue collected each year. \n President Reagan recognized that we have a problem with discriminatory health plans when he proposed in 1985 that Congress enact what now is section 89 of the Internal Revenue Code. That provision was based on good tax policy; but it is a bad law. \n I know we must get rid of section 89. But we cannot permit employers to continue to provide health benefits in a discriminatory manner and have all taxpayers pick up the tab. \n I have sponsored legislation today with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bentsen to repeal the current section 89 rules and to replace them with simpler rules--rules that do not take days to understand. \n My concern is with the small businesses in Montana that do not discriminate but must comply with the current absurdity of section 89. I want to get rid of section 89 as soon as possible. But a vote tonight to repeal it will be ignored by the House and is nothing more than a public relations show that will have no effect. \n The real work on section 89 will be done next week when those of us on the Senate Finance Committee sit down to write a substitute for section 89. If during that meeting I find that we are not solving the problems of my constituents and small firms elsewhere, then I will push for repeal of section 89. But first, we must try to come up with workable nondiscrimination rules.  \n \n', "\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, from the Committee on Armed Services, I report favorably the attached listing of nominations. \n Those identified with a single asterisk (*) are to be placed on the Executive Calendar. Those identified with a double asterisk (**) are to lie on the Secretary's desk for the information of any Senator since these names have already appeared in the Congressional Record and to save the expense of printing again. \n \n"]

Mr. President, I know the patience of the Senator from Nebraska, because I have been fishing with him, and he is very patient. \n Mr. President, my question is this: Did the members of your committee, the Armed Services Committee, explore the options for seeking the result that the Secretary wished? For instance, did they explore the concept of bonuses for performance or lumpsum payments, not salaried, in addition to existing salary? Were there any other options selected by the Armed Services Committee to achieve the results without disturbing the whole pay network of the Federal Government? \n \n', '\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Library Services and Construction Act [LSCA]. This bill represents the largest Federal program which specifically funds libraries. The money go toward construction of facilities, general library services, library services for Indian tribes, foreign language materials acquisition, and library literacy programs. \n There can be no questioning the importance of this bill to my own State of Vermont. Two-thirds of the libraries in Vermont serve populations of fewer than 2,000 people. These are geographically isolated areas without access to major metropolitan libraries. Yet, while geographically isolated, they are not isolated from access to information, thanks to the services rendered to them through the LSCA. \n Title I of the bill provides my State of Vermont with education and training for its librarians, 90 percent of whom come to libraries with no training whatsoever. \n In 1988, Title II of the bill provided Vermont with $100,000 for building construction and improvement. Last year, Vermont used this money to help finance a new town library where previously none existed. Federal funds only accounted for 10 percent of the total costs, but to a small State such as my own 10 percent is crucial. \n Title III of the bill is probably the single most important title of LSCA for my State. Title III moneys go to facilitate interlibrary loans and access to information. Because of this money, each of the small libraries throughout the State can access the large research libraries such as the one situated at the University of Vermont. This telecommunications capability is at no expense to the university--all access is done through computer network. Clearly, this effective and essential activity could not have been provided without Federal money. \n Furthermore, LSCA provided Vermont with $50,000 worth of computer printed catalog cards which otherwise would have had to be done by staff. It provided consultant services to libraries for computer training, catalog updates, and general services. Finally, LSCA has provided institutional libraries with long overdue services for the blind and handicapped. \n This bill clearly expands services to States. It gives children and adults a glimpse into a whole new world by giving them access to information and books. I have outlined the financial assistance provided to Vermont through the LSCA--what I cannot do so easily but which is far more important is tally the countless number of children and adults who have benefited from this program. \n \n', "\n\n  Mr. WIRTH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor several Vietnamese-American students from the State of Colorado whose outstanding academic performance merits special notice by this Congress. \n The Vietnamese-American Cultural Alliance of Colorado, a nonprofit service organization composed of Vietnamese immigrants and Americans of Vietnamese origin, has selected several young people to be honored in recognition of their exemplary academic standing. These youngsters have made a highly successful transition from one distant and different culture to another and now, because of their courage, perseverance, and excellence as citizens of this country, have become exemplary students. For this reason I feel each one of these students deserves special acknowledgement by the Senate. \n The recipients of the 1989 Colorado Awards for Academic Excellence are: Erica Le, kindergarten; Giang Kiet Lihn, grade 6; Mary Hoatam, grade 5; Tien Duc Nghia, grade 4; John Nguyen, grade 1; Nguyen Thi Tran, grade 6; Nguyen Nam, grade 3; Than Cao Thien, grade 5; Le Thi Nga, grade 4; Lam My Thanh, grade 4; Nguyen Hai, grade 2; Nguyen Phu, grade 2; Tran Thi Thu, grade 4; Chung Huy, grade 3; Nguyen Thao, grade 4; Nguyen Tuyet, grade 4; Huynh Ngoc Linh, grade 2; Mimi Nguyen Thien Huong, grade 3; Lyna Nguyen, grade 8; Hoang Thi Huong, grade 6; Jimmy Ngo, grade 6; Le Tram, grade 7; Dang Quoc Anh, grade 8; Tran Tan, grade 6; Nguyen Chau Ha, grade 9; Hang Hoang, grade 8; Luong Chay, grade 7; Tran Uyen Phan, grade 8; Nguyen Hoang, grade 7; Nguyen Chi, grade 6; Vo Truc, grade 8; Pham Thi Diem, grade 8; Nguyen Quynh Nhu, grade 8; Nguyen Thi Thu-Quang, grade 9; Nguyen Thi Hanh, grade 8; Van Tan Tai, grade 8; Quach Cam Ha, grade 8; Jackie Nguyen, grade 6; Ann Nguyen, grade 7; Hang Bao Quoc, grade 9; Nguyen Thi B. Hanh, grade 8; Vu Quoc Khanh, grade 12; Vu Thanh, grade 10; Ngo Trong Khanh, grade 11; Ngo Duy Anh, grade 12; Nguyen Kim Thuy, grade 11; Trieu Nguyen Hahn, grade 11; Nguyen T. Phu, grade 11; Ngo Tuan, grade 11; Ngo Tai, grade 9; Ngo Tu, grade 9; Nguyen Ha, grade 11; Tran Thu Quyen, grade 12; Nguyen Anh Khoa, grade 10; Nguyen Thanh, grade 10; Tran Uyen-Thy, grade 11; Nguyen H. Minh, grade 12; Nguyen Dung, grade 11; Tram Manh Quang, grade 10; Sue Do, grade 12; Vo Thuy Vu, grade 11; Nguyen M. Hanh, grade 12; Nguyen Trien, grade 11; Dang Kim Chau, grade 9; Vo Thanh Phuong, grade 11; Ly Tien, grade 11; Bui Quoc Thang, grade 12; Bui Thuy Trang, grade 9; Sue Nguyen, grade 11. \n Unfortunately, space does not permit a description of each student's accomplishments. However, I can say that each of these students has achieved extraordinary academic standing--earning a perfect 4.0 grade point average or better. \n Let me also extend my thanks to the Vietnamese-American Cultural Alliance of Colorado, without whose support and dedication to community service, these special kids would not have been recognized. Henry Tuoc V. Pham, the president of the alliance, has done an outstanding job of encouraging academic excellence among young Vietnamese-American students. His hard work, along with the love and support of their families, certainly shows in the fine academic performance of these 69 young Coloradans.  \n \n", "\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on October 16, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski presented an address entitled `America's Changing Global Role' at a dinner in honor of Paul H. Nitze at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University in Washington, DC. \n In his speech, Dr. Brzezinski describes the evolution of the U.S. role in the world, from isolationism in the early part of the century to active engagement in World War II and the cold war. He then looks forward to America's leading a coalition of democratic States in contructing the post-cold war international order. \n Because of the timeliness and vision of Dr. Brzezinski's address, I want to share it with my Senate colleagues. \n \n", '\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a number of my colleagues on the Education Subcommittee in proposing this package of technical amendments to the Impact Aid Program. \n This package of legislation is very important if we are to continue our support for the Impact Aid Program, which provides money to school districts who have been federally impacted through a military installation or by land acquisition by the Federal Government. \n These amendments are technical corrections to the Impact Aid Program incorporated into Public Law 100-297, the Hawkins-Stafford Act. This law rewrote the impact aid formula in an attempt to bring greater equity to the program. This new formula was worked out under the advice of the school districts and the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools. \n Unfortunately, some problems arose with the new language that the orginal drafters could not predict. It is essential that we pass this technical package, otherwise school districts throughout this country will face shortfalls in their funding because impact aid payments will not be able to be made. \n Without these technical amendments, the Department of Education will not be able to make B payments to school districts. During the reauthorization of the Impact Aid Program, the power to prorate B payments was inadvertently omitted. If there is a shortfall in appropriations, the Department of Education does not have the legal authority to reduce the payments to these B districts. A shortfall occurred this year and has unfortunately caused a standstill in the program. Districts that depend on this money to operate are facing the possibility of closing their school house doors if they do not receive this money. \n Another unfortunate problem that arose because of the shortfall in appropriations was districts who had an increase in the number of federally connected children could not be compensated for this increase. These technical amendments remove the hold harmless cap on the A program so payments can be made for these new students. In order to remove the cap and allow a flow of funds for new students to these A districts, we also had to place a cap on the 3(d)2(B) section. \n One of the unintended results of the new formula was the increase in the 3(d)2(B) reserves. Although the cost runs about $10 million annually, $50 million was reserved for this section as required by the new law. In order to release funds for the new children in the A districts, a cap of $20 million was placed on the 3(d)2(B) section to release the extra $30 million. The $20 million is well above the amount that has ever been paid for the 3(d)2(B) payments and the remaining $30 million will flow into the A section providing relief to districts with larger increases of new children. If we do not release these funds, we will be asking school districts to educate more children with less money. \n This package has bipartisan support and I hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass these necessary and very important technical amendments. \n \n']
